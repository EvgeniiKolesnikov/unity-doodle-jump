### About me
I graduated from university in 2012, when dinosaurs in "_abibas_" costumes walked the roads. I'm here to improve my skills. Worked as a freelancer, made flash games, banners. My strong point is humor, although it is not particularly welcome here. My goal is to be a **Frontend** developer or a **Unity** developer.
